In the dynamic landscape of data visualization and business intelligence, dashboards have emerged as crucial tools for organizations to gain insights, monitor performance, and make informed decisions. Dashboards come in various flavors, each tailored to meet specific needs. Two prominent categories are **Customer Facing** and **Internal Facing** dashboards. Let's dive into the differences between these two types and explore their key characteristics and popular tools.

## Customer Facing Dashboards

**High Emphasis on User Experience (UX)**

Customer facing dashboards are crafted with meticulous attention to user experience. These dashboards cater to external stakeholders, such as clients, customers, and partners, making it imperative to provide a seamless and visually appealing experience. Low latency, responsive design, and a user-friendly interface are central to customer satisfaction.

**Optimized Data Pipeline**

In the realm of customer facing dashboards, optimizing data processing takes center stage. To ensure minimal latency and real-time insights, various techniques are employed, including caching and pre-computation. These strategies help reduce API latency and enable smoother interactions for end users.

**Popular Tools for Customer Facing Dashboards**

1. **Frolic**: Frolic is an open source developer tool to create customer facing dashboards much faster. You can directly connect your database to the project and use ready made APIs to query data. You no longer have to write custom APIs for different dashboard components and create/maintain SQL queries for them.

2. **Creating Dashboards from Scratch**: Some organizations opt to develop custom dashboards from the ground up, leveraging front-end technologies and data visualization libraries like D3.js or Chart.js. This approach allows for maximum flexibility in design and functionality.

## Internal Facing Dashboards

**Emphasis on Internal Reporting**

Internal facing dashboards, on the other hand, are tailored to serve the needs of an organization's internal teams and stakeholders. These dashboards focus on delivering critical insights, metrics, and KPIs to aid decision-making within the company.

**UI and Experience Considerations**

While internal facing dashboards certainly provide valuable insights, they may place less emphasis on the user interface and overall experience. The primary goal is to efficiently convey data and information to internal users, rather than creating an aesthetically pleasing interface.

**Popular Tools for Internal Facing Dashboards**

1. **Tableau**: Tableau is a widely adopted business intelligence platform that enables organizations to create powerful internal dashboards. Its robust features allow for deep data exploration, analysis, and visualization.

2. **PowerBI**: Microsoft's PowerBI is another prominent tool for internal data visualization. It offers seamless integration with other Microsoft products and provides an array of visualization options.

3. **Metabase**: Metabase is an open-source business intelligence tool that focuses on simplicity and ease of use. It's particularly suitable for creating internal dashboards that cater to different teams within the organization.

## Conclusion

In the realm of data visualization, dashboards serve as indispensable tools for organizations to derive insights, track progress, and drive decision-making. While both customer facing and internal facing dashboards share the core purpose of conveying data-driven insights, they are tailored to distinct audiences and purposes.

Customer facing dashboards prioritize a seamless user experience and optimized data processing to captivate external stakeholders. In contrast, internal facing dashboards concentrate on delivering critical information to internal teams, with less emphasis on UI design.

Whether you're crafting dashboards to engage customers or empower internal teams, the choice of tools and design considerations will play a pivotal role in delivering actionable insights and driving business success.
